Problem statement: 
A platform connecting small NGOs with MNCs to facilitate the mandatory 2% CSR contribution.

Introduction to problem statement and solution: 
Small NGOs face challenges in securing funds, while MNCs struggle to fulfill mandatory CSR contributions efficiently. This disconnect leads to missed opportunities for impactful social initiatives. Our platform Prithvi Sahayog bridges the gap between those who want to contribute to environmental sustainability and those who are on the frontlines, making a difference. By bringing together individual donors, multinational corporations, and NGOs, we create a powerful network of supporters dedicated to protecting our planet.
